Arduino and related code (includes the sensor web server - this location is not
ideal, but fine for now).

NOTE(dlila): arduino build and deployment tools are kind of sucky. The IDE is
ridiculously particular about where code is located.
TODO(dlila): Find out how to build this stuff from the command line and setup
vim with ctags or get the eclipse plugin to work.
Bonus points: build arduino with Google's balze. Once this is done, we'll be
able to actually have a buildable repository. Right now these files have to be
copied around if one wants to build them.
